Hi1 This project was made to explore the topic of encapsulation by making a bank account class with a private variable, which can be accessed through public methods of the class. The methods allow money to be deposited and the balance to be checked. When the code runs, the user is allowed to add money or veiw the balance of the private class field using the classes methods.
